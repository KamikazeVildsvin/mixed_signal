# Mixed Signal Simulation in xschem
This repo shows an example of how to simulate a digital standard cell block generated by `yosys` and mapped to a spice netlist.

A simple 4 bit upcounter has been written in verilog and mapped to the `sky130` PDK using `yosys`. Using the two binaries `vlog2Verilog` and
`vlog2Spice` from `qflow`, this RTL digital block can be expressed as a spice netlist. `xschem` is then used to create a symbol and simulate
the digital counter using `ngspice`. The spice netlist can be found in `synth.spice`.
